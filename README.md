This is a project recreating the board game Can't Stop.  It's a push-your-luck dice game where you race up different tracks based on what you roll.  
Rules for Can't Stop can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Stop_(board_game)

The goal of this project is to provide an easy to grasp interface for playing Can't Stop while offering several different aesthetics to customize backgrounds, music, and player pieces.
